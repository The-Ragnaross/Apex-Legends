Upon the release of every season following the game's launch, one new character was added. At time of writing, the game is in season 12 and there are 20 legends. Of the current 20 legends there are five recon type legends, four defense type legends, two support type legends, and a whopping nine attack type legends. As already stated, all 20 legends have a different way that they fulfill their role as whatever type of legend that they are. On this page, we will see an in depth overview of each character including their personality, their back story, and of course their abilities.</h2>
