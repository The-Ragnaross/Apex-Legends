                <h2>When the game was released there were 8 characters. Two Recon type, two defense type, one support type, and three attack type. Upon the release of every season following the game's launch, one new character was added. At time of writing, the game is in season 12 and there are 20 legends. Of the current 20 legends there are five recon type legends, four defense type legends, two support type legends, and a whopping nine attack type legends. As already stated, all 20 legends have a different way that they fulfill their role as whatever type of legend that they are. On this page, we will see an in depth overview of each character including their personality, their back story, and of course their abilities.</h2>

            <h2>Very little is known about the technological tracker, not their real name, age, homeworld, or even their gender. What we do know is that Bloodhound is a true hunter. With their tracker ablity, they can see footprints left behind by their opponents as well as evidence of a fight or even someones death. With the eye of the all father, Bloodhound will be able to tell how many enemies are in the area by scanning in front of themself. If an opponent is in the scanned area, Bloodhound and their team mates will be able to see their enemies through solid objects for several seconds. Finally, the beast of the hunt ability enhances both of the previously mentioned ability, causing the footprints and other marks to be even easier to see than before and causing the eye of the all father to recharge faster. The beast of the hunt also highlights enemies and darkens everything else, so the main focus of Bloodhound's sight is their targets. Finally, when beast of the hunt is active, Bloodhound gets a massive speed boost making them a much more formidable force. Bloodhound speaks with an Icelandic accent, sprinkling Icelandic words into their sentences here and there. As far as their personality goes, Bloodhound is loyal to their friends, and unafraid of their enemies. Even when speaking to a foe, Bloodhound is respectful, saying things like ""You fought, this makes you brave and no coward" in the face of a victory. As far as recon characters go, Bloodhound is a solid choice.</h2>

            <h2>The shielded fortress, Gibraltar is the first defense character on the roster. When the game was released, Gibraltar was the only character who's real name (Makoa Gibraltar) was apart of their legend title. Gibraltar's home planet is the world called Solace, he stands at 6'5" and is 30 years old. He is a fun loving person who feels his best when he protects those weaker than him, and his abilities are perfect for just that. With his gun shield, he can aim down the sights of his weapon and a transparent shield on his arm will defend him from harm. His tactical ability is also a shield, a dome shield. When he throws this down, a bubble of energy similar to that of his gun shiled will be generated, stopping bullets and explosives from passing through it, while also allowing poeple to slip through unabaited. Finally his ultimate ability is his defensive bombardment strike, when he calls this down, missiles will rain down from the sky and explode on impact with the ground. Of course, if he himself is for some reason not able to escape the area of effect, he always has that handy dome shield to keep himself safe while his enemies endure the attack. Gibraltar is a very friendly person, making friends with whoever he can, often times calling people brother or "Brudda", as he says it. If your team is in need of a tank character, Gibraltar is your man.</h2>

            <h2>Lifeline, combat medic, drummer, and free spirit. When Ajay Che found out that her parents were profiting off of a war, selling guns to both sides, she left home for the first time. At first she made her way by joining a band as their new drummer. In a way this was a new passion for her, but also a way to rebel against her parents. Later on she realized she could do more to help the war effort. And so it was she enlisted as a combat medic, not only healing wounded soldiers, but fighting off any threat that would keep her from doing so. A 24 year old from the planet Psamathe, her support type is well earned with her abilities. With her combat revive, she can have a drone help a downed legend back to their feet while she keeps fighting. With the same drone comes her tactical ability, by activating the drone, any nearby legends who's health isn't 100% will be quickly healed by remaining in close proximity. And finally her ultimate, the Lifeline package, upon ariving, the care package will provide armor upgrades, gun attachments, and useful healing items to the whole party, bolstering their ability both to fight, and recover from a fight. While doing what she can to aid and comfort her team, she's very cocky towards her enemies, saying things like "I don't even think you're trying, this was too easy" or "They don't just call me lifeline because I save a life". With Lifeline on your team, being wounded is far less distressing, knowing that when you're hurt, you have someone to patch you up, and when you fall, you have someone skilled in picking you back up.</h2>
