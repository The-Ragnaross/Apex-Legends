      <h3>Legends</h3>
      <p>
        When the game was released there were 8 characters. Two Recon type, two defense type, one support type, and three attack type. Upon the release of every season following the game's launch, one new character was added. At time of writing, the game is in season 12 and there are 20 legends. Of the current 20 legends there are five recon type legends, four defense type legends, two support type legends, and a whopping nine attack type legends. As already stated, all 20 legends have a different way that they fulfill their role as whatever type of legend that they are. On this page, we will see an in depth overview of each character including their personality, their back story, and of course their abilities.

      <h3>Maps</h3>
      <p>
        Originally, the game only contained one map, that being Kings Canyon, and this remained true from season zero all the way through season 2. After that more and more maps were released, and the maps that already existed in the game got changed and updating in all sorts of ways. On this page, we will look at all the different maps, how they fit into the games story, how they changed, and why.

     <h3>Game Modes</h3>
      <p>
        On launch, Apex Legends was solely a battle royale game. The only other option for play was a training mode that the player was forced to play as a tutorial before getting into the battle royale mode. Ever since there have been many many limited time game modes that have been added and taken away for various reasons, and even one permenant mode. On this page we will look at the game modes, what they were added for, and if they'll be coming back.
