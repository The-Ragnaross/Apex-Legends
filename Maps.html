            <h1>The Maps</h1>
            <h2>Originally, the game only contained one map, that being Kings Canyon, and this remained true from season zero all the way through season 2. After that more and more maps were released, and the maps that already existed in the game got changed and updating in all sorts of ways. On this page, we will look at all the different maps, how they fit into the games story, how they changed, and why.</h2>

            <h3>Kings Canyon has gone through many changes since it's release, some areas being changed, some being replaced, some times brand new parts of the map are added altogether. But through it all the main idea of kings canyon has remained the same. It was once a research facility that was abandoned and then used in the Apex games. This map is covered in rough terain featuring steep hills, sheer cliffs, and even places you can fall off and be eliminated on the spot.</h3>
            <h3>World's edge was added in season 3 of the game. For the entirity of that season it was the only map you could play, kings canyon being vaulted for a while. This wasteland of an island is covered in discolored water and scorched rock. Surrounding it on all sides is a seemingly endless ocean of lava. This island also seems like it may have been used for research of some kind at one point, covered in buildings of different sorts. Some of these building seem like living quarters, some seem like they may have been power plants, and theres one that looks like it was a factory before<h3>
