        <h1>Game Modes</h1>
        <h2>On launch, Apex Legends was solely a battle royale game. The only other option for play was a training mode that the player was forced to play as a tutorial before getting into the battle royale mode. Ever since there have been many many limited time game modes that have been added and taken away for various reasons, and even one permenant mode. On this page we will look at the game modes, what they were added for, and if they'll be coming back.</h2>
